break


12/29   
break


1/7  
Extra wee  k to catch up on things we didn’t expect


1/14   
Extra week to catch up on things we didn’t expect


1/21   
finished




Code  
Our code will accomplish these things:
Determine velocity using a Riemann sum of the acceleration data
Make a noise when it thinks it’s at the apex of the flight

Goal:  
Throw a pi into the air and have it detect when it’s at the apex of its flight

Ideas:  
Use a crossbow to throw the pi up
This also means we need an aerodynamic shell or something around the pi

Resources:  
Crossbow  
Wood   
Exercise resistance band  
screws/nails  
CNC (maybe, for trigger mechanism)  
Pi  
Pi capsule (3d printed)  
3d printer  
Screws/nuts  
Laser cutter/acrylic  
Accelerometer   
battery  
Breadboard  
Wires  
Tape  
LED  

Prototyping stuff:  
CAD Design for raspberry pi shell:  

The holes on the back are for indicator LEDs, a button to change stages, and a power switch.
We later modified the printed part by using a saw to cut a hole into the side so that we could plug the pi into the computer without having to take it out of the shell.
